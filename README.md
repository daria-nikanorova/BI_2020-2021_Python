# Visualization in Python

**1st task: line plot** I created a line plot, which shows nutrient content (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) of McDonald's meat meals.

**2nd task: fasta length distribution** I created a line plot, which shows sequencing length distribution on fasta file.

**3rd task: my fav plot** I created a pie chart, which shows average nutrient content in McDonald's meals. As we can see this food is rich in carbohydrates.
